It establishes:

- Legal classification of the platform

# 2. Platform Legal Classification

## 2.1 Legal Status

N4T is classified as:

> A technology platform providing digital tools that allow users to create, publish, discover, and communicate regarding community events.

N4T is NOT:

- A travel agency  
- A ticket seller  
- A marketplace for goods  
- A payment intermediary for event participation  
- An escrow provider  
- An agent or representative of organizers  
- A party to any agreement between users  

---

## 2.2 Core Non-Participation Principle

All agreements regarding participation in events are concluded directly between users outside the platform.

N4T does not guarantee:

- Event execution  
- Safety  
- Organizer competence  
- Event accuracy  
- Legal compliance of events  

---

# 3. Business Model Boundaries

## 3.1 Permitted Revenue Streams

N4T MAY generate revenue through:

1. Subscription fees for access to digital platform features  
2. Premium feature upgrades  
3. Visibility boosts / ranking features  
4. Advertising placements

All monetization must relate exclusively to digital platform functionality or visibility.

---

## 3.2 Prohibited Revenue Streams

N4T MUST NOT:

- Collect payments for event participation  
- Act as intermediary for ticket sales  
- Hold funds on behalf of organizers  
- Process participant-to-organizer payments

Any such feature requires formal reclassification of the platform model and amendment of this SSOT.

Users acknowledge that off-road and automotive activities involve inherent risks, including:

- Personal injury  
- Vehicle damage  
- Property damage

Participation in any event is voluntary and at the user’s own risk.

N4T bears no responsibility for physical, material, or financial harm resulting from participation in user-organized activities.

---

## 4.2 Limitation of Liability

N4T liability shall be limited to:

- User misconduct  

---

## 4.3 User-Generated Content

Users are solely responsible for:

- Event descriptions  
- Safety claims  
- Promotional statements  
- Uploaded media

N4T acts as a hosting provider and does not pre-approve or verify user content.

N4T reserves the right (but not obligation) to remove content.

---

# 5. Moderation & Enforcement

N4T may suspend or terminate accounts for:

- Violations of Terms

# 7. Advertising Framework

If advertising is enabled:

- Advertisers are solely responsible for claims  

Advertising does not imply endorsement.

Triggers mandatory legal review.

Amendments to this SSOT require:

---

# 12. Model Stability Statement

N4T is permanently structured as a technology infrastructure platform.
