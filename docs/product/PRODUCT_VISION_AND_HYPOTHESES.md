# Need4Trip — Product Vision & Core Hypotheses

## 1. Product Vision

Need4Trip (N4T) is a lightweight web-based tool that helps **organizers of group trips** collect participants and manage trips **without the chaos of chats and spreadsheets**.

The product is not a social network and not a marketplace.
Its primary purpose is to **remove organizational friction** from group trips.

---

## 2. Primary ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Primary user:**  
An organizer of group trips who regularly gathers people for travel or outdoor activities.

This includes:
- Enthusiast organizers (clubs, communities, friends)
- Professional guides running paid trips

**Key characteristics:**
- Organizes trips at least once per month
- Uses chats (Telegram, WhatsApp) as the main coordination tool
- Personally bears the cognitive and administrative load

Participants are a **secondary user group**.

---

## 3. Core Problem

Organizing trips in chats does not scale.

Observed issues:
- Participant lists are collected manually ("+1" messages)
- Important information gets lost in message streams
- Organizers repeatedly resend the same updates
- For larger groups, organizers maintain private spreadsheets
- All coordination relies on the organizer’s constant attention

As group size grows, **organizational overhead grows disproportionately**.

---

## 4. Value Proposition

Need4Trip helps trip organizers:
- collect participants via a single link
- keep trip information in one consistent place
- reduce manual coordination and repeated communication

Unlike chats and spreadsheets, N4T provides **structure without adding friction** and works directly in the browser without requiring app installation.

---

## 5. Aha-Moment

A user experiences the core value of N4T when:
> They create a trip, share a link, and see participants sign up on their own while all information stays organized in one place.

This moment should occur within the first 10 minutes of usage.

---

## 6. Monetization Hypothesis (Non-binding)

Users are expected to pay not for trips themselves, but for:
- reduced organizational effort
- repeatable trip organization
- professional handling of paid or recurring trips
- access to new participants (future)

Monetization is expected to follow **validated product value**, not precede it.

---

## 7. Non-Goals

During Beta, Need4Trip is explicitly NOT:
- a social network
- a marketplace for trips
- a chat replacement
- a booking or payment platform

Any features not supporting the core organizational job are out of scope.

---

## 8. Success Definition (Preliminary)

The product demonstrates value if:
- organizers repeatedly create trips
- trips attract multiple participants
- organizers reduce reliance on chat-based coordination

Monetization decisions are deferred until these signals are validated.
