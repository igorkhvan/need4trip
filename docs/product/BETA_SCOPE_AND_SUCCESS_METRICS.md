# Need4Trip — Beta Scope & Success Metrics

## 1. Purpose of Beta

The purpose of the beta launch is to validate whether Need4Trip solves a **real organizational problem** for trip organizers.

Beta is not a growth phase and not a monetization phase.
It is a **controlled product experiment**.

---

## 2. Beta Definition

Beta is considered successful if it provides **clear product signals**, not positive feedback.

Beta users are expected to:
- use the product for real trips
- compare it against their existing workflow
- abandon it if it does not provide value

---

## 3. In-Scope Functionality (What MUST work)

### 3.1 Core Organizer Flow

Organizers must be able to:
- create a trip (event)
- define basic trip information (time, place, description)
- share a public link to the trip
- see a list of participants
- update trip information
- observe changes reflected to participants

This flow must work **without explanation or guidance**.

---

### 3.2 Participant Flow

Participants must be able to:
- open a trip link without installing an app
- understand the trip context immediately
- join the trip with minimal friction
- leave the trip if needed

Any participant confusion invalidates beta results.

---

### 3.3 Clubs (Supporting Role Only)

Clubs are allowed during beta but are not the primary value proposition.

Rules:
- Clubs must not be required to create a trip
- Clubs act as containers for repeat trips
- Clubs should not introduce additional cognitive load

If clubs interfere with trip creation, they are considered **out of scope for beta value**.

---

## 4. Explicitly Out of Scope (Beta)

The following are intentionally excluded from beta:

- trip discovery or marketplace features
- recommendation feeds or rankings
- analytics dashboards
- monetization and payments
- advanced role management
- social features (comments, likes, chats)
- gamification
- marketing experiments

These exclusions are deliberate and not considered missing functionality.

---

## 5. Success Metrics (Primary)

### 5.1 Activation Rate (Primary Metric)

**Definition:**
Percentage of registered organizers who create at least one trip.

**Purpose:**
Measures whether users understand and adopt the core value.

---

### 5.2 Participation Level

**Definition:**
Average number of participants per trip.

**Purpose:**
Measures whether trips created in N4T are real and used.

---

### 5.3 Repeat Organizer Usage

**Definition:**
Percentage of organizers who create a second trip.

**Purpose:**
Measures retained value and product usefulness.

This is the most reliable indicator of product-market fit.

---

## 6. Secondary Signals (Qualitative)

The following qualitative signals should be observed and recorded:

- reduction in chat-based coordination
- fewer repeated messages by organizers
- participants self-managing their participation
- organizers describing the experience as "simpler" or "calmer"

These signals support, but do not replace, primary metrics.

---

## 7. Beta Timeframe

- Minimum duration: 2 weeks
- Recommended duration: 3–4 weeks
- Beta must not be extended without a decision

Prolonging beta reduces signal clarity.

---

## 8. Post-Beta Decision Requirement

At the end of beta, one of the following decisions must be made:

- proceed to monetization exploration
- simplify UX and repeat beta
- reframe the core problem
- stop or pivot the product

Remaining undecided is not an acceptable outcome.

---

## 9. Non-Goals of Beta Evaluation

Beta is not intended to:
- validate pricing
- test marketing channels
- maximize usage numbers
- satisfy all user requests

The only goal is to validate **core product value**.
